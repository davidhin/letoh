Conditions of use for discount codes
Discount codes ("Coupons") may be applied to pre-paid hotel bookings, excluding bookings at non-participating hotels whose list will be made available along with each specific Coupon.
Participating hotels are subject to change at any time.
Coupons with a discount in a specific currency (e.g. 10 Euro off) cannot be used for bookings paid for in a different currency.
If the discount is based on a percentage (e.g. 10% off), in case of booking of multiple rooms (i.e., when you books 2 or more rooms in the same booking) the discount only applies to the price of the first room included in the booking request.
For specific restrictions on use of Coupons please see the relevant Coupon communication.
Only one Coupon per booking may be used. Usual booking terms and conditions apply and all bookings are subject to availability. Coupons cannot be sold or transferred.

All taxes, fees, charges, and surcharges are applicable to reservations made using Coupons. These charges must be paid at the time of the reservation or directly at the hotel and are your responsibility. Coupons have value only when redeemed in accordance with all terms and conditions of the offer. Coupons cannot be returned for cash or its equivalent.

Single-use Coupons will be deemed fully used once a qualifying reservation has been made and will not be returned or replaced and there will be no refund if a Coupon is redeemed in part. Multiple-use Coupons will be deemed fully used in accordance with the restrictions set out in the individual Coupon terms and conditions.

If the travel stay dates are changed after the use of a Coupon, then that Coupon will not apply to the changed travel schedule. Coupons may not be used for any previously purchased reservation.
Coupons cannot be used by travel agencies affiliated to the Hotels.com travel agency program.
Hotels.com reserves the right to vary these conditions of use or to withdraw Coupons at any time.
TERMS, CONDITIONS AND WARRANTIES

Tax Recovery Charge

The tax charge on Hotels.com Special Internet Rate hotel transactions is a recovery of all applicable transaction taxes (e.g. sales and use, occupancy, room tax, excise tax, value added tax, etc.) that Hotels.com pays to the vendors (e.g. hotels, etc.) in connection with your travel arrangements.

Hotels.com is not the vendor collecting and remitting said tax to the applicable tax authorities. The vendors bill all applicable taxes to Hotels.com and Hotels.com remits such tax directly to the vendor. Hotels.com is not a co-vendor associated with the vendor with whom we book or reserve our customer's travel arrangements.

Taxability and the appropriate tax rate vary greatly by location. Hotel.com's actual tax cost paid to the vendor may vary from the tax recovery charge, depending upon the rates, taxability, etc. in effect at the time of the actual use of the hotel, automobile, etc. by our customer.

Service Fee
We retain service fees as compensation in servicing your travel reservation. Service fees vary based on the amount and type of hotel reservation.

PAY NOW ONLINE OR PAY LATER AT HOTEL DETAILS

With certain hotels, you may be presented with the option to pay online immediately or to pay later at the hotel itself. If you select the option to pay online immediately, you will be charged the amount in the currency that you select immediately. If you select to pay later at the hotel itself, the hotel will charge you in the local currency of the relevant hotel at the time of your stay. Tax rates and foreign exchange rates could change in the time between booking and stay. You shall provide the details of your payment card and the supplier or Hotels.com will often have to verify: (i) the validity of the payment card (through a charge of a nominal value that is either refunded within a few days or deducted from the final payment due to the supplier) and, (ii) the availability of funds on the payment card (to be confirmed by the bank issuing your credit card). Hotels.com reserves the right to cancel your booking if full payment is not received in a timely fashion (please see Supplier Rules and Restrictions).
Many bank and credit card companies charge their account holders a transaction fee when the card issuer and the merchant location (as defined by the card brand (e.g. Visa, MasterCard, American Express) are in different countries. The currency exchange rate, if applicable, and any transaction fee are determined solely by the bank or other agency processing the transaction. These fees may be applied by the card issuer as a charge to the cardholders account. This means the amount listed on your credit or debit card statement may be a different figure than the figure shown on the billing summary page for a reservation booked on this Website. If you have any questions about these fees or any exchange rate applied to your booking, please contact your bank.

PRICES

The price of the travel services will be as quoted on the website from time to time, except in cases of obvious error. Prices are liable to change at any time, but changes will not affect bookings already accepted.  Despite Hotels.com’s best efforts, some of the travel services listed on the website may be incorrectly priced. HOTELS.COM EXPRESSLY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CORRECT ANY PRICING ERRORS ON OUR WEBSITE AND/OR ON PENDING RESERVATIONS MADE UNDER AN INCORRECT PRICE. IN SUCH EVENT, IF AVAILABLE, WE WILL OFFER YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO KEEP YOUR PENDING RESERVATION AT THE CORRECT PRICE OR WE WILL CANCEL YOUR RESERVATION WITHOUT PENALTY. Hotels.com is under no obligation to provide travel services to you at an incorrect (lower) price, even after you have been sent confirmation of your booking.

HOW WE DISPLAY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ON HOTELS.COM

Travelers have many options on Hotels.com to help them find the perfect hotel.  The “sort” settings allow travellers to order search results to their preference, whether based on price, verified review score, or other criteria.  The “filter” settings also allow travellers to include or exclude various options to suit their travel needs.  If no options are selected, Hotels.com will show a range of relevant options in the search results, based on the criteria outlined below.


In our default sort of “Our Favourites”, the sort order reflects the relevance of properties to your search criteria, as we want to make sure you are able to quickly and easily find the offer that is right for you.  We measure relevance by taking into account factors like a property’s location, its review scores, the popularity of the property (measured by how many travellers on our sites make bookings at that property), the quality of the content provided by the property, and the competitiveness of the property’s rates and availability, all relative to other properties meeting your chosen search criteria. The compensation which a property pays us for bookings made through our sites is also a factor for the relative ranking of properties with similar offers, based on the relevance factors described above. On our non-default sorts (e.g., by price or by star rating), properties with similar results will be ordered based on the factors above.

Additionally, Hotels.com continually optimizes our service to provide the best experience to travellers.  Accordingly, we may test different default sort order algorithms from time to time.

CHANGES OR CANCELLATIONS

You can change or cancel your lodging booking either online under your Reservations when signed into your Hotels.com account, or by calling our customer services number 1800-985-309.

You can change your guest name, bed type, smoking preference, special requests, accessibility options, room type, number of guests and travel dates at no charge to you by Hotels.com. Lodging suppliers may impose other change and/or cancellation fees.  Charges vary by reservation, so please review your confirmation email for details.

You agree to pay any supplier required cancellation or change fees that you incur. In limited cases, some hotels do not permit changes to or cancellations of reservations after they are made, as indicated in the rules and restrictions for the hotel reservation. You agree to abide by the terms and conditions imposed with respect to your prepaid hotel reservations.
In the event that a hotel is unable to honour your booking, Hotels.com will not be liable for any cost incurred due to relocation.
 If you do not show for the first night of your reservation but plan to check-in for subsequent nights in the reservation, you must confirm the reservation with Hotels.com no later than the original date of check-in to prevent cancellation of the whole booking. If you do not confirm the booking changes with Hotels.com the whole booking may be cancelled and refunds will only be due to you in line with the Rules and Restrictions of the particular hotel, as notified in the booking process.

These terms and conditions may not be changed by any unauthorized person, including employees of Hotels.com.


Hotels.com™ Rewards TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Hotels.com Rewards is a Hotels.com loyalty program (the “Program”). When you book and stay 10 nights with us, we give you 1 free night to redeem. This free night does not include taxes and fees (“Free Night”).
All bookings must be made online or with our call centre. You can only collect nights or redeem Free Nights at an eligible Hotels.com Rewards property.
The Program is open to anyone over 18 years old who signs up to Hotels.com with a valid email address, and then joins the Program. Companies, associations, or other groups may not join. Employees of Expedia, Inc. will not be able to collect nights or redeem Free Nights if they make a booking through the B.E.S.T. program, or if they use an employee discount. If an Expedia, Inc. employee makes a booking without using their discount, they will be able to collect Hotels.com Rewards nights.

Collecting nights

You will collect 1 night for every night you stay at an eligible Hotels.com Rewards property. Collect 10 nights and we give you 1 Free Night. You must be signed in to your Hotels.com account when you book online so we can add the nights you collect to your account after your stay. If you make a booking with us by phone, you must tell us the email address on your account so we know where to add the nights. Only Hotels.com Rewards members collect nights. Other guests on the same booking do not, and you cannot collect nights for any hotel bookings you made before you joined the Program.

We will add any nights you collect to your account up to 72 hours after you check out of the Hotels.com Rewards property. If you collect nights but we later believe that you did not complete your hotel stay (an “Invalid Night”), we reserve the right to remove these Invalid Nights from your account. This could happen if you cancel your booking or did not turn up at the hotel, which would make the nights invalid. You cannot collect any Invalid Nights towards the 10 nights you need to redeem a Free Night.

You can check your account to see how many nights you have collected at any time. Just sign in at Hotels.com, or phone our call centre. You are responsible for making sure your account is correct. If you believe that you have not collected the correct amount of nights, we will look into this for you. If any bookings are invalid as mentioned earlier, we will remove them from your account.

In addition to the information above, you will not collect nights for the following:
1. Bookings made with an affiliate Hotels.com site
2. Bookings made before you joined the Program
3. Package bookings i.e. hotel + flight
4. Some bookings made using a discount coupon, voucher or code – you will need to check the terms for each of these
5. Bookings made through Group Travel Services
6. Bookings that do not cost you anything, i.e. are free
Redeeming Free Nights

When you collect 10 nights, we will give you 1 Free Night to redeem at any eligible Hotels.com Rewards property. You can redeem your Free Night online, or give us a call and we will make your booking for you.
The maximum value of your Free Night is based on the value of the 10 nights you collected as long as they have not expired. This value is equal to the average daily rate, excluding taxes and fees, of the nights you previously stayed. If you collected a night at a Hotels.com Secret Price (defined below), this price rather than the regular price will be used for the purposes of the calculation. You must pay for taxes, fees, meals and any other costs associated with your Free Night.
If you used different currencies when collecting your 10 nights, the value of each night is currently calculated using the currency associated with the territory you were in when you joined the Program.
Free Night stays are subject to all applicable booking terms and conditions. You will not collect a night when you redeem your Free Night. Collected nights have no cash value, and you cannot redeem your Free Night for cash.
If you redeem your Free Night on a stay that is less than the maximum value of your Free Night, you will not get the difference in cash, credit or anything else. You can redeem your Free Night on a stay that costs more than the maximum value of your Free Night – you just pay the difference.

If you have more than 1 Free Night to redeem, you can choose which booking you want to apply it to. You cannot combine your Free Night with any other offer, discount coupon, voucher or code, unless the terms for each of these say you can. This means that when you book a stay and redeem your Free Night, you generally will not be able to get an additional discount on that booking.

If you redeem your Free Night on a booking that is longer than 1 night, we will automatically apply its value to the most expensive night in that booking, subject to its maximum value.
Free Night stays are subject to all applicable cancellation policies that are passed onto us by the Hotels.com Rewards property. If you cancel a Free Night within the property’s cancellation window, we will return it to your account within 72 hours of your cancellation. If you cancel a Free Night outside of the property’s cancellation window, it will not be returned to your account.
If you want to change the dates of a booking that includes the Free Night you redeemed, you will need to cancel the booking, wait for the Free Night to be returned to your account, then rebook so you can apply your Free Night to your new booking.

Hotels.com Rewards tiers

The Program has 3 tiers: Hotels.com Rewards, Hotels.com Rewards Silver and Hotels.com Rewards Gold. You will join as a Hotels.com Rewards member. When you collect 10-29 nights in a membership year, you will qualify for Hotels.com Rewards Silver. When you collect 30 nights or more in a membership year, you will qualify for Hotels.com Rewards Gold. A membership year runs for a year from the date you first created an account, and each anniversary after that.

Silver and Gold members have a dedicated phone number they can call 24/7 to make or discuss their bookings. And there are other benefits like early sale access and exclusive offers. These will all be available within 2 weeks of qualifying for Silver or Gold, and will last for the rest of that membership year and the whole of the following membership year. If you do not collect enough nights to stay in Silver or Gold, we will move you down a tier for the next membership year.

Changes and Termination
Your nights will not expire as long as you keep your account active at least once every 12 months. This means you must collect a night or redeem a Free Night in that time, and when you do, the expiry date will be extended for another 12 months. If you do not collect nights or redeem Free Nights in a 12 month period, your nights will expire and we may deactivate your account. If this happens, your nights will not be reissued. Sign into your account to check when your nights are due to expire.
We may change our terms and conditions at any time, with or without notice, including the rules for collecting nights, the different membership tiers and their qualification requirements and associated benefits, the rules for redeeming your Free Night, the list of eligible Hotels.com Rewards properties, and the maximum value of a Free Night. We may communicate these changes to you by email or on our Hotels.com website so please make sure you check your account regularly.

Hotels.com Rewards has no end date and will continue until we close it, which could happen at any time. If we do close the Program, you will have 30 days from when we announce its closure to redeem any Free Nights you have in your account. After that date, you will lose your Free Nights and you will not be compensated.
By continuing to collect nights and redeem Free Nights with Hotels.com Rewards, you accept any changes to these terms and conditions. You are responsible for keeping up to date on any changes that we may make. The most current version will always be available on our website.

General Hotels.com Rewards Terms & Conditions

We reserve the right to discontinue your membership if you act fraudulently or use our loyalty program in a way that does not comply with our terms and conditions, or any federal or state laws, regulations, statutes or ordinances. If we discontinue your membership, you may lose your collected nights and benefits. We also have the right to take appropriate administrative and/or legal action, including criminal prosecution if necessary.
While you are signed up to Hotels.com Rewards, we may communicate any updates to your account or transactions to you by email. We may take back your nights at any time. You cannot sell or transfer your nights, or combine them with another member’s nights. Nights are not transferable if a member dies, if there is a domestic relations issue, or otherwise by operation of law. You agree that all disputes, claims and causes of action like these are resolved individually, without needing to use any form of class action, and exclusively by the appropriate court located in Dallas County, Texas.

If you have any questions about these terms and conditions or your rights and obligations, these will be governed, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Texas.

The Program is void where prohibited by law. Our failure to enforce any provision of these terms and conditions shall not constitute a waiver of that or any other provision. Our decision on all questions or disputes regarding the Program is final.

PRICE GUARANTEE TERMS

Price Guarantee - If you find a lower rate on Hotels.com or on another website by 23:59 local time the day before your stay we will, refund the difference to you.  Package reservations are not eligible for this guarantee, and other conditions apply as per the below.

Submitting a Claim


• For non-refundable bookings:  Hotels.com will compensate you by issuing a coupon with a value corresponding to the price difference. The coupon can be used on a future booking on the Hotels.com site. You must contact the customer call centre or submit your request using the online Price Guarantee form by 23:59 local time the day before your stay. The room with the lower rate must be available for booking at the time you contact us, as determined by our customer service representatives.


• For refundable bookings:
a) Where the cheaper rate is found on Hotels.com: You can either call the customer call centre by 23:59 local time the day before your stay or cancel your existing booking online under Your Bookings when signed into your Hotels.com account and rebook online at the cheaper price. If you call us, the room with the lower rate must be available for booking at the time you contact us, as determined by our customer service representatives. At your request, the customer service representative will rebook the room found at the lower rate using the payment details that you give on the phone. Your original booking will be cancelled by our customer service representative, and you will receive a refund for the price originally paid. Refunds will be processed by Hotels.com immediately, but your bank can take up to 30 days to process the refund.
b) Where the cheaper rate is found on a competitor’s site: Hotels.com will refund the price difference. You must contact the customer call centre or submit your request using the online Price Guarantee form by 23:59 local time the day before your stay. The room with the lower rate must be available for booking at the time you contact us, as determined by our customer service representatives. Refunds will be processed by Hotels.com upon verification of your request, but your bank can take up to 30 days to process the refund.

Comparison must be to same itinerary - The Price Guarantee is available only for exact itinerary matches, including property, room type, applicable cancellation policy, and dates of travel as booked through hotels.com. In addition, the comparison must be to the same property purchased stand-alone through another website. In other words, properties booked through another website as part of a package are not eligible for this guarantee. The guarantee applies to the cost of booked travel, as presented on your booking confirmation, including any taxes and fees collected by us from you at the time of booking. The guarantee does not apply to any taxes or fees collected by any third party from you, such as those taxes and fees a hotel may collect directly from you when you stay at the hotel. It is not available for bookings on websites where the property or other booking details are unknown until after purchase. You must meet all requirements imposed on the lower price (if any), including, without limitation, residency, regional and age-related requirements.

Comparison must be available to the General Public - The Price Guarantee applies only to prices both advertised and available to the general public. It also applies to our Secret Prices. The Price Guarantee does to apply to rates offered on competitors’ membership program websites; corporate discounts or rates; group, charter, rewards program, incentive, meeting, convention, consolidator or interline prices; prices obtained via auction or similar process; or prices available only by using a coupon or other promotion not offered to the general public. The lower rate may not come from a website where you call to get the rate, or from an e-mail that you received.

Claim Verification - All requests are subject to verification by hotels.com. We will not accept screenshots or other purported evidence of a lower price that we cannot independently confirm. Nor will we verify any request that we believe, in our sole discretion, is the result of a printing or other error or is made fraudulently or in bad faith.

Refunds for Verified Requests – Verified refund requests will receive a credit to the credit card used for the reservation. Where you have paid for your hotel at the time of booking, we will send your refund upon verification of your request.  Where you have chosen to pay later at the hotel, you will pay the hotel the original price upon arrival and we will send your refund after you have completed your stay.  Note, it may take up to 30 days or the next billing cycle for your refund to appear on your statement.

Changes - We reserve the right in our sole discretion to modify or discontinue the Price Guarantee or to restrict its availability to any person, at any time, for any or no reason, and without prior notice or liability to you. The terms that are in effect at the time of your claim will determine your eligibility under the guarantee. Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms & Conditions shall not constitute a waiver of that provision.
