Then I checked the price, $9! It was such a low price that I couldn't help but plan my honeymoon immediately at this hotel. Little did I know that that it was only for 1 person (that's my bad, I should have checked), but the room is Tiny! They should've said something about the fact that the toilet IS the only available seating. Unbelievable. Un. Believable."
